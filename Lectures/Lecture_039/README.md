## üß© What ‚ÄúBigInt‚Äù Means
- **BigInt** stands for **Big Integer** ‚Äî a way to store and work with numbers **much larger** than what built‚Äëin types (`int`, `long long`) can hold.
- C++ itself **does not** have a built‚Äëin BigInt type.  
- Instead, you either:
  1. **Write your own BigInt class** (store digits in a string or vector and do math manually), or  
  2. **Use a library** like GMP, Boost.Multiprecision, etc.

---

## üìè Why We Need It
- Built‚Äëin integer types have **fixed size** (e.g., `long long` is usually 8 bytes, max ~9√ó10¬π‚Å∏).
- If you try to store something bigger, it **overflows** and gives wrong results.
- BigInt can handle **hundreds, thousands, or even millions of digits** ‚Äî limited only by your computer‚Äôs memory.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- The number is stored as **digits** (often in reverse order for easier math) inside a `std::string` or `std::vector<int>`.
- Operations like add, subtract, multiply are done **digit by digit**, just like you‚Äôd do on paper.
- Example for addition:
  1. Start from the last digit of both numbers.
  2. Add them, keep track of carry.
  3. Move left until all digits are processed.

---

## üîç What You Can Do With BigInt
A good BigInt implementation can:
- Add, subtract, multiply, divide big numbers
- Compare them (greater, smaller, equal)
- Find factorials, Fibonacci numbers, powers, etc., for huge values
- Work in cryptography, combinatorics, or scientific calculations

## üÜö BigInt vs Normal Integers
| Feature        | Normal int / long long | BigInt |
|----------------|------------------------|--------|
| Size limit     | Fixed (4‚Äì8 bytes)      | Only limited by memory |
| Speed          | Very fast (hardware)   | Slower (software math) |
| Built‚Äëin?      | Yes                    | No (need code or library) |
| Use case       | Everyday numbers       | Extremely large numbers |

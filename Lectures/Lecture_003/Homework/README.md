# Introduction to c++

## Homework Questions: 

#### Q1: Two numbers are given, print their product
#### Q2: Two numbers are given a and b, print a-b
#### Q3: Print 6x3 in output, donâ€™t print 18, just 6*3 should be in the output screen.
#### Q4: If we have only 4 bits, How 3 and -6 will be written in 4 bits.

**1) 3 = 0011**

**2) -6 = 1010**

-  Convert in Binary: 6 = 0110
-  1's compliment: 1001
-  2's compliment: 1001 + 1 = 1010
- so, -6 = 1010;
#### Q5: If we have only 5 bits, How 13 and -16 will be written in 5 bits.
**1) 13 = 01101**

**2) -16 = 10000**
- 16:
- Convert in Binary: 16 = 10000
- 1's compliment: 01111
- 2's compliment: 01111 + 1 = 10000
- so, -16 = 10000;

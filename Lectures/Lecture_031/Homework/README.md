## Homework Questions:

**Q1:** Print sum of each column in 2D array. [Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_031/Homework/1.cpp)

**Q2:** Given 2 matrices A and B, Print A-B. [Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_031/Lecture_Code/Add_Subtract.cpp)

**Q3:** Given a matrix of size n\*n, Print sum of diagonal elements.  
Ex:   
```
1 2 3  
4 5 6  
7 8 9  
```
Its answer: 1+5+9, 3+5+7, So the total sum will be 1+5+9+3+5+7 = 30.  
Here we can see that 5 is included 2 times, so we should include it only 1 time, so the final answer will be, 30-5 = 25.  
So the final answer will be 25. [Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_031/Homework/3.cpp)

**Q4:** What is the column major order?
### Column Major Order:

**For Index Calculation:**

`Index = column_Index * number_of_rows + row_Index`

**For Row and Column Index Calculation:**

`row_Index = Index % number_of_rows`  
`column_Index = Index / number_of_rows`


**Q5:** Largest Element: Find and print the largest element in the 2D array. [Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_031/Homework/5.cpp)

**Q6:** Smallest Element: Find and print the smallest element in the 2D array. [Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_031/Homework/6.cpp)

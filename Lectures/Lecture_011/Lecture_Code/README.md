# While, do While , Switch 
**Q(asked in class):** The difference between for, while, and do-while loops in programming?

- `for` loop: Used when the number of iterations is known. It has initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

- `while` loop: Used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition. The loop continues until the condition is false.

- `do-while` loop: Similar to `while`, but the code block is executed at least once before the condition is checked.

The choice depends on the specific requirements of your code.

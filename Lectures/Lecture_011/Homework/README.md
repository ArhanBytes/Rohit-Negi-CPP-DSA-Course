## Homework Questions: 
**Q1:** : Take a number n from the user and print all the even numbers between 1 and n(inclusive). Do this using while and do while loop separately. [Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_011/Homework/Q1.cpp)

**Q1.1:** Take a number n from the user and print all the ODD numbers between 1 and n(inclusive). Do this using while and do while loop separately. [Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_011/Homework/Q1_1.cpp)

**Q2:** Find the factorial of a number n using a while loop and do a while loop. [Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_011/Homework/Q2.cpp)


**Q3:** Given a number n, print all the numbers from 1 to n(inclusive) which are not divisible by 3 and 5. (use Continue here). [Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_011/Homework/Q3.cpp)

**Q4:** Given a number n, print the corresponding month of it. For n=1, print Jan, n=2, print Feb…, if the user puts any invalid number, don’t do anything. (Use switch here). [Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_011/Homework/Q4.cpp)

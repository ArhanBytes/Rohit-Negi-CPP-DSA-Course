# Introduction to Arrays
## Homework Questions: 
**Q1:** : Take n elements from user input and find its sum with the help of an array. [Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_016/Homework/Q1.cpp)

**Q2:** Calculate the average of elements in an array of size 18.[Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_016/Homework/Q2.cpp)

**Q3:** Find the index of a specific element in an array, if the element is nor present, print -1. Ask the size of the array from the user and then implement it. [Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_016/Homework/Q3.cpp)

**Q4:** Create an array of char types and store ‘a’ to ‘z’ in it. Then print the element of the arrays. [Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_016/Homework/Q4.cpp)

**Q5** Find the second largest element in an array of unique elements of size n. Where n>3. [Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_016/Homework/Q5.cpp)

**Q6:** Find the third smallest element in an array of unique elements size n. Where n>3. [Here](https://github.com/ArhanBytes/Rohit-Negi-CPP-DSA-Course/blob/main/Lectures/Lecture_016/Homework/Q6.cpp)

**Q7:** What is Byte addressable?

Ans: **Byte Addressable Memory**:
- In byte addressable memory, each **individual byte** (which consists of 8 bits) has a unique address.
- When we say a memory location is "byte addressable," it means that you can access or manipulate **one byte at a time**.
- For example, if you have an array of integers, each integer occupies 4 bytes (32 bits). In a byte addressable system, you can read or modify any of those 4 bytes independently.
- Modern computers primarily use byte addressable memory because it simplifies data access and manipulation.

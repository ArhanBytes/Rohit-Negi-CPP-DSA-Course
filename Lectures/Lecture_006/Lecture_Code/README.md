### Q(asked in class): Why is my C++ code printing ASCII values instead of characters?

Ans: The issue is that the expression `'a' + col - 1` is being evaluated as an integer, not a character. This is because the 'a' character is implicitly converted to its ASCII value (which is an integer) for the arithmetic operation.

```bash
cout << static_cast<char>('a' + col - 1) << " ";
```

- In this modified code, static_cast<char>('a' + col - 1) ensures that the result of the expression is treated as a char, so the corresponding character is printed instead of the ASCII value. This should give you the output youâ€™re expecting.
